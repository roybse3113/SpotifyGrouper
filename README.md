# SpotifyGrouper

Description: Spotify-Grouper is an application that focuses on allowing users to log in to their Spotify Accounts and gain access to collaborative/group funcionalities in the database of other users. Primarily, based on preferences of artists, music, and etc, users are put into groups which offers a range of functionalities (i.e, recommended artists, playlists, collaborative group playlists, etc)

Milestone #1 (11/22):
I mainly focused on setting the project up, primarily working on the back-end. Specifically, I made to sure first plan out the way in which I wanted to structure the schema (users, groups).
